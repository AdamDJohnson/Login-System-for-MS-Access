Welcome to the official repository for the Midnight Modshop! Here you will find projects that are
bring worked on, as we believe that education trumps commercial interests. Feel free to come here
and learn from any projects that we are tinkering away on. Some projects may have nothing to do
with game console repair or modification, but learning software development is important, too.

If you wish to explore our portfolio further, feel free to visit:
